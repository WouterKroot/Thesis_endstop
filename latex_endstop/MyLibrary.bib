  abstract = {In 1998, Sherman and Guillery proposed that there are two types of inputs to cortical neurons; drivers and modulators. These two forms of input are required to explain how, for example, sensory driven responses are controlled and modified by attention and other internally generated gating signals. One might imagine that driver signals are carried by fast ionotropic receptors, whereas modulators correspond to slower metabotropic receptors. Instead, we have proposed a novel mechanism by which both driver and modulator inputs could be carried by transmission through the same types of ionotropic receptors. In this scheme, the distinction between driver and modulator inputs is functional and changeable rather than anatomical and fixed. Driver inputs are carried by excitation and inhibition acting in a push-pull manner. This means that increases in excitation are accompanied by decreases in inhibition and vice versa. Modulators correspond to excitation and inhibition that covary so that they increase or decrease together. Theoretical and experimental work has shown that such an arrangement modulates the gain of a neuron, rather than driving it to respond. Constructing drivers and modulators in this manner allows individual excitatory synaptic inputs to play either role, and indeed to switch between roles, depending on how they are linked with inhibition.},

  abstract = {The problem discussed is the relationship between the firing of single neurons in sensory pathways and subjectively experienced sensations. The conclusions are formulated as the following five dogmas: 1. To understand nervous function one needs to look at interactions at a cellular level, rather than either a more macroscopic or microscopic level, because behaviour depends upon the organized pattern of these intercellular interactions. 2. The sensory system is organized to achieve as complete a representation of the sensory stimulus as possible with the minimum number of active neurons. 3. Trigger features of sensory neurons are matched to redundant patterns of stimulation by experience as well as by developmental processes. 4. Perception corresponds to the activity of a small selection from the very numerous high-level neurons, each of which corresponds to a pattern of external events of the order of complexity of the events symbolized by a word. 5. High impulse frequency in such neurons corresponds to high certainty that the trigger feature is present. The development of the concepts leading up to these speculative dogmas, their experimental basis, and some of their limitations are discussed.},

  abstract = {A dynamic balance between strong excitatory and inhibitory neuronal inputs is hypothesized to play a pivotal role in information processing in the brain. While there is evidence of the existence of a balanced operating regime in several cortical areas and idealized neuronal network models, it is important for the theory of balanced networks to be reconciled with more physiological neuronal modeling assumptions. In this work, we examine the impact of spike-frequency adaptation, observed widely across neurons in the brain, on balanced dynamics. We incorporate adaptation into binary and integrate-and-fire neuronal network models, analyzing the theoretical effect of adaptation in the large network limit and performing an extensive numerical investigation of the model adaptation parameter space. Our analysis demonstrates that balance is well preserved for moderate adaptation strength even if the entire network exhibits adaptation. In the common physiological case in which only excitatory neurons undergo adaptation, we show that the balanced operating regime in fact widens relative to the non-adaptive case. We hypothesize that spike-frequency adaptation may have been selected through evolution to robustly facilitate balanced dynamics across diverse cognitive operating states.},

  abstract = {Visual illusions and mental imagery are non-physical sensory experiences that involve cortical feedback processing in the~primary visual cortex. Using laminar functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in two studies, we investigate if information about these internal experiences is visible in the activation patterns of different layers of primary visual cortex (V1). We find that imagery content is decodable mainly from deep layers of V1, whereas seemingly `real' illusory content is decodable mainly from superficial layers. Furthermore, illusory content shares information with perceptual content, whilst imagery content does not generalise to illusory or perceptual information. Together, our results suggest that illusions and imagery, which differ immensely in their subjective experiences, also involve partially distinct early visual microcircuits. However, overlapping microcircuit recruitment might emerge based on the nuanced nature of subjective conscious experience.},

To explore these rules systematically, we integrated information from extensive literature curation and large-scale experimental surveys into a data-driven, biologically realistic simulation of the awake mouse primary visual cortex. The model was constructed at two levels of granularity, using either biophysically detailed or point neurons. Both variants have identical network connectivity and were compared to each other and to experimental recordings of visual-driven neural activity. While tuning these networks to recapitulate experimental data, we identified rules governing cell-class-specific connectivity and synaptic strengths. These structural constraints constitute hypotheses that can be tested experimentally. Despite their distinct single-cell abstraction, both spatially extended and point models perform similarly at the level of firing rate distributions for the questions we investigated. All data and models are freely available as a resource for the community.},

In visual cortex, convergence renders target neurons responsive to complex stimuli. Yet, convergence typically sends multiple stimuli to a target, and the behaviorally relevant stimulus must be selected. We used two stimuli, activating separate electrocorticographic V1 sites, and both activating an electrocorticographic V4 site equally strongly. When one of those stimuli activated one V1 site, it gamma synchronized (60--80~Hz) to V4. When the two stimuli activated two V1 sites, primarily the relevant one gamma synchronized to V4. Frequency bands of gamma activities showed substantial overlap containing the band of interareal coherence. The relevant V1 site had its gamma peak frequency 2--3~Hz higher than the irrelevant V1 site and 4--6~Hz higher than V4. Gamma-mediated interareal influences were predominantly directed from V1 to V4. We propose that selective synchronization renders relevant input effective, thereby modulating effective connectivity.},

Through its application, we reveal principles that relate cell type to synaptic properties and intralaminar circuit organization in the mouse and human cortex. The dynamics of excitatory synapses align with the postsynaptic cell subclass, whereas inhibitory synapse dynamics partly align with presynaptic cell subclass but with considerable overlap. Synaptic properties are heterogeneous in most subclass-to-subclass connections. The two main axes of heterogeneity are strength and variability. Cell subclasses divide along the variability axis, whereas the strength axis accounts for substantial heterogeneity within the subclass. In the human cortex, excitatory-to-excitatory synaptic dynamics are distinct from those in the mouse cortex and vary with depth across layers 2 and 3.},

  abstract = {Distinct subtypes of inhibitory interneuron are known to shape diverse rhythmic activities in the cortex, but how they interact to orchestrate specific band activity remains largely unknown. By recording optogenetically tagged interneurons of specific subtypes in the primary visual cortex of behaving mice, we show that spiking of somatostatin (SOM)- and parvalbumin (PV)-expressing interneurons preferentially correlates with cortical beta and gamma band oscillations, respectively. Suppression of SOM cell spiking reduces the spontaneous low-frequency band ({$<$}30-Hz) oscillations and selectively reduces visually induced enhancement of beta oscillation. In comparison, suppressing PV cell activity elevates the synchronization of spontaneous activity across a broad frequency range and further precludes visually induced changes in beta and gamma oscillations. Rhythmic activation of SOM and PV cells in the local circuit entrains resonant activity in the narrow 5- to 30-Hz band and the wide 20- to 80-Hz band, respectively. Together, these findings reveal differential and cooperative roles of SOM and PV inhibitory neurons in orchestrating specific cortical oscillations.},

  abstract = {Neural oscillatory activities have been shown to play important roles in neural information processing and the shaping of circuit connections during development. However, it remains unknown whether and how specific neural oscillations emerge during a postnatal critical period (CP), in which neuronal connections are most substantially modified by neural activity and experience. By recording local field potentials (LFPs) and single unit activity in developing primary visual cortex (V1) of head-fixed awake mice, we here demonstrate an emergence of characteristic oscillatory activities during the CP. From the pre-CP to CP, the peak frequency of spontaneous fast oscillatory activities shifts from the beta band (15--35\,Hz) to the gamma band (40--70\,Hz), accompanied by a decrease of cross-frequency coupling (CFC) and broadband spike-field coherence (SFC). Moreover, visual stimulation induced a large increase of beta-band activity but a reduction of gamma-band activity specifically from the CP onwards. Dark rearing of animals from the birth delayed this emergence of oscillatory activities during the CP, suggesting its dependence on early visual experience. These findings suggest that the characteristic neuronal oscillatory activities emerged specifically during the CP may represent as neural activity trait markers for the experience-dependent maturation of developing visual cortical circuits.},

  abstract = {Self-organization in biological nervous systems during the lifetime is known to largely occur through a process of plasticity that is dependent upon the spike-timing activity in connected neurons. In the field of computational neuroscience, much effort has been dedicated to building up computational models of neural plasticity to replicate experimental data. Most recently, increasing attention has been paid to understanding the role of neural plasticity in functional and structural neural self-organization, as well as its influence on the learning performance of neural networks for accomplishing machine learning tasks such as classification and regression. Although many ideas and hypothesis have been suggested, the relationship between the structure, dynamics and learning performance of neural networks remains elusive. The purpose of this article is to review the most important computational models for neural plasticity and discuss various ideas about neural plasticity's role. Finally, we suggest a few promising research directions, in particular those along the line that combines findings in computational neuroscience and systems biology, and their synergetic roles in understanding learning, memory and cognition, thereby bridging the gap between computational neuroscience, systems biology and computational intelligence.},

  abstract = {A recent computational theory suggests that visual processing in the retina and the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) serves to recode information into an efficient form (Atick and Redlich, 1990). Information theoretic analysis showed that the representation of visual information at the level of the photoreceptors is inefficient, primarily attributable to a high degree of spatial and temporal correlation in natural scenes. It was predicted, therefore, that the retina and the LGN should recode this signal into a decorrelated form or, equivalently, into a signal with a ``white'' spatial and temporal power spectrum. In the present study, we tested directly the prediction that visual processing at the level of the LGN temporally whitens the natural visual input. We recorded the responses of individual neurons in the LGN of the cat to natural, time-varying images (movies) and, as a control, to white-noise stimuli. Although there is substantial temporal correlation in natural inputs (Dong and Atick, 1995b), we found that the power spectra of LGN responses were essentially white. Between 3~and 15~Hz, the power of the responses had an average variation of only {\textpm}10.3\%. Thus, the signals that the LGN relays to visual cortex are temporarily decorrelated. Furthermore, the responses of X-cells to natural inputs can be well predicted from their responses to white-noise inputs. We therefore conclude that whitening of natural inputs can be explained largely by the linear filtering properties (Enroth-Cugell and Robson, 1966). Our results suggest that the early visual pathway is well adapted for efficient coding of information in the natural visual environment, in agreement with the prediction of the computational theory.},

  abstract = {1. The classically defined receptive field of a visual neuron is the area of visual space over which the cell responds to visual stimuli. It is well established, however, that the discharge produced by an optimal stimulus can be modulated by the presence of additional stimuli that by themselves do not produce any response. This study examines inhibitory influences that originate from areas located outside of the classical (i.e., excitatory) receptive field. Previous work has shown that for some cells the response to a properly oriented bar of light becomes attenuated when the bar extends beyond the receptive field, a phenomenon known as end-inhibition (or length tuning). Analogously, it has been shown that increasing the number of cycles of a drifting grating stimulus may also inhibit the firing of some cells, an effect known as side-inhibition (or width tuning). Very little information is available, however, about the relationship between end- and side-inhibition. We have examined the spatial organization and tuning characteristics of these inhibitory effects by recording extracellularly from single neurons in the cat's striate cortex (Area 17). 2. For each cortical neuron, length and width tuning curves were obtained with the use of rectangular patches of drifting sinusoidal gratings that have variable length and width. Results from 82 cells show that the strengths of end- and side-inhibition tend to be correlated. Most cells that exhibit clear end-inhibition also show a similar degree of side-inhibition. For these cells, the excitatory receptive field is surrounded on all sides by inhibitory zones. Some cells exhibit only end- or side-inhibition, but not both. Data for 28 binocular cells show that length and width tuning curves for the dominant and nondominant eyes tend to be closely matched. 3. We also measured tuning characteristics of end- and side-inhibition. To obtain these data, the excitatory receptive field was stimulated with a grating patch having optimal orientation, spatial frequency, and size, whereas the end- or side-inhibitory regions were stimulated with patches of gratings that had a variable parameter (such as orientation). Results show that end- and side-inhibition tend to be strongest at the orientation and spatial frequency that yield maximal excitation. However, orientation and spatial frequency tuning curves for inhibition are considerably broader than those for excitation, suggesting that inhibition is mediated by a pool of neurons.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

We discuss where different types of PE are encoded, how they are generated, and the different functional roles they fulfill. We suggest that while encoding of PE is a common computation across brain regions, the content and function of these error signals can be very different and are determined by the afferent and efferent connections within the neural circuitry in which they arise.},

We developed a unified circuit model demonstrating how feedforward and feedback inputs are integrated to produce three forms of contextual effects in mouse primary visual cortex (V1). First, reanalyzing existing data, we discovered that increasing stimulus size only weakly increases the area of V1 neural response, conflicting with previous models of surround suppression (SS). Second, through modeling, we found that, in Layer 2/3, (1) SS and its contrast dependence are largely inherited from Layer 4; (2) Inverse responses (IR) -- size-tuned responses to a gray ``hole'' in a full-field grating -- are driven by feedback connections provided they are sufficiently wide; (3) Cross-orientation surround facilitation is induced by the summation of feedback input driving IR with the feedforward-driven classical center response.

Brain injury or altered afferent input due to environmental changes, novel experience and learning new skills are known as modulators of brain function and underlying neuroanatomic circuitry. During the past decade invasive animal studies and in vivo imaging techniques have delineated the correlates of experience dependent reorganisation.

  abstract = {The cerebral cortex of the mouse has become one of the most important systems for studying information processing and the neural correlates of behavior. Multiple studies have examined the first stages of visual cortical processing: primary visual cortex (V1) and its thalamic inputs from the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN), but more rarely in the lateral posterior nucleus (LP) in mice. Multiple single-unit surveys of dLGN and V1, both with electrophysiology and two-photon calcium imaging, have described receptive fields in anesthetized animals. Increasingly, awake animals are being used in physiological studies, so it is important to compare neuronal responses between awake and anesthetized state. We have performed a comprehensive survey of spatial and temporal response properties in V1, dLGN, and lateral posterior nucleus of both anesthetized and awake animals, using a common set of stimuli: drifting sine-wave gratings spanning a broad range of spatial and temporal parameters, and sparse noise stimuli consisting of flashed light and dark squares. Most qualitative receptive field parameters were found to be unchanged between the two states, such as most aspects of spatial processing, but there were significant differences in several parameters, most notably in temporal processing. Compared with anesthetized animals, the temporal frequency that evoked the peak response was shifted toward higher values in the dLGN of awake mice and responses were more sustained. Further, the peak response to a flashed stimulus was earlier in all three areas. Overall, however, receptive field properties in the anesthetized animal remain a good model for those in the awake animal. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The primary visual cortex (V1) of the mouse and its inputs from visual thalamus (dLGN), have become a dominant model for studying information processing in the brain. Early surveys of visual response properties (receptive fields) were performed in anesthetized animals. Although most recent studies of V1 have been performed in awake animals to examine links between vision and behavior, there have been few comprehensive studies of receptive field properties in the awake mouse, especially in dLGN and lateral posterior nucleus. We have performed a comparative survey of receptive fields in dLGN, lateral posterior nucleus, and V1 in anesthetized and awake mice. We found multiple differences in processing of time-varying stimuli, whereas the spatial aspects of receptive fields remain comparatively unchanged.},

The model comprises hidden layers of state-space or dynamic causal models, arranged so that the output of one provides input to another. The ensuing hierarchy furnishes a model for many types of data, of arbitrary complexity. Special cases range from the general linear model for static data to generalised convolution models, with system noise, for nonlinear time-series analysis. Crucially, all of these models can be inverted using exactly the same scheme, namely, dynamic expectation maximization. This means that a single model and optimisation scheme can be used to invert a wide range of models. We present the model and a brief review of its inversion to disclose the relationships among, apparently, diverse generative models of empirical data. We then show that this inversion can be formulated as a simple neural network and may provide a useful metaphor for inference and learning in the brain.},

There are several architectural principles of functional brain anatomy that have emerged from careful anatomic and physiologic studies over the past century. These principles are considered in the light of representational learning to see if they could have been predicted a priori on the basis of purely theoretical considerations. We first review the organisation of hierarchical sensory cortices, paying special attention to the distinction between forward and backward connections. We then review various approaches to representational learning as special cases of generative models, starting with supervised learning and ending with learning based upon empirical Bayes. The latter predicts many features, such as a hierarchical cortical system, prevalent top-down backward influences and functional asymmetries between forward and backward connections that are seen in the real brain.},

In this way, cortical representations of the sensory environment can incorporate new information about the world, depending on the relevance or value of particular stimuli1,6,9. Neuromodulation is required for cortical plasticity, but it is uncertain how subcortical neuromodulatory systems, such as the cholinergic nucleus basalis, interact with and refine cortical circuits13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24. Here we determine the dynamics of synaptic receptive\,field plasticity in the adult primary auditory cortex (also known as AI) using in vivo whole-cell recording. Pairing sensory stimulation with nucleus basalis activation shifted the preferred stimuli of cortical neurons by inducing a rapid reduction of synaptic inhibition within seconds, which was followed by a large increase in excitation, both specific to the paired stimulus. Although nucleus basalis was stimulated only for a few minutes, reorganization of synaptic tuning curves progressed for hours thereafter: inhibition slowly increased in an activity-dependent manner to rebalance the persistent enhancement of excitation, leading to a retuned receptive field with new preference for the paired stimulus. This restricted period of disinhibition may be a fundamental mechanism for receptive field plasticity, and could serve as a memory trace9,25 for stimuli or episodes that have acquired new behavioural significance.},

Higher-order sensory cortical areas, with their increasingly complex receptive fields and integrative properties, are thought to be critical nodes for this function. This is especially true in the primate visual cortex, in which functionally specialized areas are engaged in parallel streams to support diverse computations. Recent anatomical and physiological studies of the mouse visual cortex have revealed a similarly complex network of specialized higher-order areas. This structure provides a useful model for determining the synaptic and circuit mechanisms through which information is transformed across distinct processing stages. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on the layout, connectivity, and functional properties of the higher visual areas in the mouse. In addition, we speculate on the contribution of these areas to perception and action, and how knowledge of the mouse visual system can inform us about the principles that govern information processing in integrated networks.},

Decades of anatomical and physiological studies in primates and carnivores have revealed a complex parallel and hierarchical organization by which distinct visual features are distributed to, and processed by, different brain regions. However, these studies have been limited in their ability to dissect the circuit mechanisms involved in the transformation of sensory inputs into complex cortical representations and action patterns. Multiple groups have therefore pushed to explore the organization and function of higher visual areas in the mouse. Here we review the anatomical and physiological findings of these recent explorations in mouse visual cortex. These studies find that sensory input is processed in a diverse set of higher areas that are each interconnected with specific limbic and motor systems. This hierarchical and parallel organization is consistent with the multiple streams that have been found in the higher visual areas of primates. We therefore propose that the mouse visual system is a useful model to explore the circuits underlying the transformation of sensory inputs into goal-directed perceptions and actions.},

The model shows that small numbers of strong excitatory synapses can trigger dendritic Na               +               and NMDA spikes. Moreover, only a few dendritic spikes are sufficient to drive a single output action potential. As a consequence, as few as 1\% of the synaptic inputs to a neuron can determine the tuning of somatic output in vivo. These results suggest that dendritic spikes can help to make sensory representations more efficient and flexible: they require fewer connections to sustain them, and only a small number of connections need to be changed to encode a different stimulus and alter the response properties of a neuron.                        ,                             The dendrites of neocortical pyramidal neurons are excitable. However, it is unknown how synaptic inputs engage nonlinear dendritic mechanisms during sensory processing in vivo, and how they in turn influence action potential output. Here, we provide a quantitative account of the relationship between synaptic inputs, nonlinear dendritic events, and action potential output. We developed a detailed pyramidal neuron model constrained by in vivo dendritic recordings. We drive this model with realistic input patterns constrained by sensory responses measured in vivo and connectivity measured in vitro. We show mechanistically that under realistic conditions, dendritic Na               +               and NMDA spikes are the major determinants of neuronal output in vivo. We demonstrate that these dendritic spikes can be triggered by a surprisingly small number of strong synaptic inputs, in some cases even by single synapses. We predict that dendritic excitability allows the 1\% strongest synaptic inputs of a neuron to control the tuning of its output. Active dendrites therefore allow smaller subcircuits consisting of only a few strongly connected neurons to achieve selectivity for specific sensory features.},

  abstract = {Neural models of perception clarify how visual illusions arise from adaptive neural processes. Illusions also provide important insights into how adaptive neural processes work. This article focuses on two illusions that illustrate a fundamental property of global brain organization; namely, that advanced brains are organized into parallel cortical processing streams with computationally complementary properties. That is, in order to process certain combinations of properties, each cortical stream cannot process complementary properties. Interactions between these streams, across multiple processing stages, overcome their complementary deficiencies to compute effective representations of the world, and to thereby achieve the property of complementary consistency. The two illusions concern how illusory depth can vary with brightness, and how apparent motion of illusory contours can occur. Illusory depth from brightness arises from the complementary properties of boundary and surface processes, notably boundary completion and surface-filling in, within the parvocellular form processing cortical stream. This illusion depends upon how surface contour signals from the V2 thin stripes to the V2 interstripes ensure complementary consistency of a unified boundary/surface percept. Apparent motion of illusory contours arises from the complementary computations of form and motion processing across the parvocellular and magnocellular cortical processing streams. This illusion depends upon how illusory contours help to complete boundary representations for object recognition, how apparent motion signals can help to form continuous trajectories for target tracking and prediction, and how formotion interactions from V2-to-MT enable completed object representations to be continuously tracked even when they move behind intermittently occluding objects through time.},

  abstract = {Visual perception seems continuous, but recent evidence suggests that the underlying perceptual mechanisms are in fact periodic---particularly visual attention. Because visual attention is closely linked to the preparation of saccadic eye movements, the question arises how periodic attentional processes interact with the preparation and execution of voluntary saccades. In two experiments, human observers made voluntary saccades between two placeholders, monitoring each one for the presentation of a threshold-level target. Detection performance was evaluated as a function of latency with respect to saccade landing. The time course of detection performance revealed oscillations at around 4 Hz both before the saccade at the saccade origin and after the saccade at the saccade destination. Furthermore, oscillations before and after the saccade were in phase, meaning that the saccade did not disrupt or reset the ongoing attentional rhythm. Instead, it seems that voluntary saccades are executed as part of an ongoing attentional rhythm, with the eyes in flight during the troughs of the attentional wave. This finding for the first time demonstrates that periodic attentional mechanisms affect not only perception but also overt motor behavior.},

Inhibitory interneurons are suggested to promote this synchronization, but it is unclear whether distinct interneuron subtypes provide different contributions. To test this, we examined single-unit recordings from barrel cortex in vivo and used optogenetics to determine the contribution of parvalbumin (PV)-- and somatostatin (SST)--positive interneurons to the synchronization of spike times across cortical layers. We found that PV interneurons preferentially promote the synchronization of spike times when instantaneous firing rates are low ({$<$}12 Hz), whereas SST interneurons preferentially promote the synchronization of spike times when instantaneous firing rates are high ({$>$}12 Hz). Furthermore, using a computational model, we demonstrate that these effects can be explained by PV and SST interneurons having preferential contributions to feedforward and feedback inhibition, respectively. Our findings demonstrate that distinct subtypes of inhibitory interneurons have frequency-selective roles in the spatiotemporal synchronization of precise spike times.},

By analyzing leading and lagging spike-timing relationships among pairs of simultaneously recorded neurons, we created a cellular-scale directed network graph. Using a module-detection algorithm to cluster neurons based on shared connectivity patterns, we uncovered two multi-regional communication modules distributed across the hierarchy. The direction of signal flow both between and within these modules, differences in layer and area distributions, and distinct temporal dynamics suggest that one module transmits feedforward sensory signals, whereas the other integrates inputs for recurrent processing. These results suggest that multiregional functional modules may be a fundamental feature of organization beyond cortical areas that supports signal propagation across hierarchical recurrent networks.},

  abstract = {We investigated the spatial organization of surround suppression in primate primary visual cortex (V1). We utilized drifting stimuli, configured to extend either from within the classical receptive field (CRF) to surrounding visual space, or from surrounding visual space into the CRF or subdivided to generate direction contrast, to make a detailed examination of the strength, spatial organization, direction dependence, mechanisms, and laminar distribution of surround suppression. Most cells (99/105, 94\%) through all cortical layers, exhibited suppression (mean reduction 67\%) to uniform stimuli exceeding the CRF, and 43\% exhibited a more than 70\% reduction. Testing with an annulus revealed two different patterns of surround influence. Some cells (37\% of cells), classical surround suppression (CSS) cells exhibited responses to an annulus encroaching on the CRF that were less than the plateau in the spatial summation curve. The majority (63\%), center-gated surround suppression (CGSS) cells, showed responses to annuli that equaled or exceeded the plateau in the spatial summation curve. Analysis suggested the CSS mechanism was implemented in all cells while the CGSS mechanism was implemented in varying strength across the sample with the extreme reflected in cells that gave larger responses to annuli than to a center stimulus. Reversing the direction of motion of the portion of the stimulus surrounding the CRF revealed four different patterns of effect: no reduction in the degree of suppression (22\% of cells), a reduction in surround suppression (41\%), a facilitation of the response above the level to the inner stimulus alone (37\%), and a facilitation of the response above that to the inner stimulus alone that also exceeded the values associated with an optimal inner stimulus. The facilitatory effects were only seen for reverse direction interfaces between the central and surrounding stimulus at diameters equal to or more than the CRF size. The zones driving the suppressive influences and the direction contrast facilitation were often spatially heterogeneous and for a number of cells bore strong comparison with the class of behavior reported for surround mechanisms in MT. This suggests a potential role, for example, in extracting information about motion contrast in the representation of the three dimensional structure of moving objects.},

  abstract = {Visual processing along the primate ventral stream takes place in a hierarchy of areas, characterized by an increase in both complexity of neuronal preferences and invariance to changes of low-level stimulus attributes. A basic type of invariance is form-cue invariance, where neurons have similar preferences in response to first-order stimuli, defined by changes in luminance, and global features of second-order stimuli, defined by changes in texture or contrast. Whether in mice, a now popular model system for early visual processing, visual perception can be guided by second-order stimuli is currently unknown. Here, we probed mouse visual perception and neural responses in areas V1 and LM using various types of second-order, contrast-modulated gratings with static noise carriers. These gratings differ in their spatial frequency composition and thus in their ability to invoke first-order mechanisms exploiting local luminance features. We show that mice can transfer learning of a coarse orientation discrimination task involving first-order, luminance-modulated gratings to the contrast-modulated gratings, albeit with markedly reduced discrimination performance. Consistent with these behavioral results, we demonstrate that neurons in area V1 and LM are less responsive and less selective to contrast-modulated than to luminance-modulated gratings, but respond with broadly similar preferred orientations. We conclude that mice can, at least in a rudimentary form, use second-order stimuli to guide visual perception.                            SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT               To extract object boundaries in natural scenes, the primate visual system does not only rely on differences in local luminance but can also take into account differences in texture or contrast. Whether the mouse, which has a much simpler visual system, can use such second-order information to guide visual perception is unknown. Here we tested mouse perception of second-order, contrast-defined stimuli and measured their neural representations in two areas of visual cortex. We find that mice can use contrast-defined stimuli to guide visual perception, although behavioral performance and neural representations were less robust than for luminance-defined stimuli. These findings shed light on basic steps of feature extraction along the mouse visual cortical hierarchy, which may ultimately lead to object recognition.},

  abstract = {In recent years, predictive coding has become an increasingly influential model of how the brain processes sensory information. Predictive coding theories state that the brain is constantly trying to predict the inputs it receives, and each region in the cortical sensory hierarchy represents both these predictions and the mismatch between predictions and input (prediction error). In this chapter, we review the extant empirical evidence for this theory, as well as discuss recent theoretical advances. We find that predictive coding provides a good explanation for many phenomena observed in perception, and generates testable hypotheses. Furthermore, we suggest possible avenues for further empirical testing and for broadening the perspective of the role predictive coding may play in cognition.},

  abstract = {Brains have evolved to optimize sensory processing. In primates, complex cognitive tasks must be executed and evolution led to the development of large brains with many cortical areas. Rodents do not accomplish cognitive tasks of the same level of complexity as primates and remain with small brains both in relative and absolute terms. But is a small brain necessarily a simple brain? In this review, several aspects of the visual cortical networks have been compared between rodents and primates. The visual system has been used as a model to evaluate the level of complexity of the cortical circuits at the anatomical and functional levels. The evolutionary constraints are first presented in order to appreciate the rules for the development of the brain and its underlying circuits. The organization of sensory pathways, with their parallel and cross-modal circuits, is also examined. Other features of brain networks, often considered as imposing constraints on the development of underlying circuitry, are also discussed and their effect on the complexity of the mouse and primate brain are inspected. In this review, we discuss the common features of cortical circuits in mice and primates and see how these can be useful in understanding visual processing in these animals.},

  abstract = {Circuits in the cerebral cortex consist of thousands of neurons connected by millions of synapses. A precise understanding of these local networks requires relating circuit activity with the underlying network structure. For pyramidal cells in superficial mouse visual cortex (V1), a consensus is emerging that neurons with similar visual response properties excite each other--, but the anatomical basis of this recurrent synaptic network is unknown. We combined physiological imaging and large-scale electron microscopy (EM) to study an excitatory network in V1. We found that layer 2/3 neurons organized into subnetworks defined by anatomical connectivity, with more connections within than between groups. More specifically, we found that pyramidal neurons with similar orientation selectivity preferentially formed synapses with each other, despite the fact that axons and dendrites of all orientation selectivities pass near ({$<$} 5 {$\mu$}m) each other with roughly equal probability. Therefore, we predict that mechanisms of functionally specific connectivity take place at the length scale of spines. Neurons with similar orientation tuning formed larger synapses, potentially enhancing the net effect of synaptic specificity. With the ability to study thousands of connections in a single circuit, functional connectomics is proving a powerful method to uncover the organizational logic of cortical networks.},

We found  evidence that V1 neurons respond to illusory contours of the Kanizsa  figures. The illusory contour signals in V1 are weaker than in V2, but  are significant, particularly in the superficial layers. The population  averaged response to illusory contours emerged 100 msec after stimulus  onset in the superficial layers of V1, and around 120--190 msec in the  deep layers. The illusory contour response in V2 began earlier,  occurring at 70 msec in the superficial layers and at 95 msec in the  deep layers. The temporal sequence of the events suggests that the  computation of illusory contours involves intercortical interaction,  and that early perceptual organization is likely to be an interactive  process.},

  abstract = {The Hubel--Wiesel (HW) model is a classical neurobiological model for explaining the orientation selectivity of cortical cells. However, the HW model still has not been fully proved physiologically, and there are few concise but efficient systems to quantify and simulate the HW model and can be used for object orientation detection applications. To realize a straightforward and efficient quantitive method and validate the HW model's reasonability and practicality, we use McCulloch-Pitts (MP) neuron model to simulate simple cells and complex cells and implement an artificial visual system (AVS) for two-dimensional object orientation detection. First, we realize four types of simple cells that are only responsible for detecting a specific orientation angle locally. Complex cells are realized with the sum function. Every local orientation information of an object is collected by simple cells and subsequently converged to the corresponding same type complex cells for computing global activation degree. Finally, the global orientation is obtained according to the activation degree of each type of complex cell. Based on this scheme, an AVS for global orientation detection is constructed. We conducted computer simulations to prove the feasibility and effectiveness of our scheme and the AVS. Computer simulations show that the mechanism-based AVS can make accurate orientation discrimination and shows striking biological similarities with the natural visual system, which indirectly proves the rationality of the Hubel--Wiesel model. Furthermore, compared with traditional CNN, we find that our AVS beats CNN on orientation detection tasks in identification accuracy, noise resistance, computation and learning cost, hardware implementation, and reasonability.},

Traditional models of working memory maintain analog representations of either the spatial location or the amplitude of a stimulus, but not both.

  abstract = {The rodent visual system has attracted great interest in recent years due to its experimental tractability, but the fundamental mechanisms used by the mouse to represent the visual world remain unclear. In the primate, researchers have argued from both behavioral and neural evidence that a key step in visual representation is `figure-ground segmentation', the delineation of figures as distinct from backgrounds. To determine if mice also show behavioral and neural signatures of figure-ground segmentation, we trained mice on a figure-ground segmentation task where figures were defined by gratings and naturalistic textures moving counterphase to the background. Unlike primates, mice were severely limited in their ability to segment figure from ground using the opponent motion cue, with segmentation behavior strongly dependent on the specific carrier pattern. Remarkably, when mice were forced to localize naturalistic patterns defined by opponent motion, they adopted a strategy of brute force memorization of texture patterns. In contrast, primates, including humans, macaques, and mouse lemurs, could readily segment figures independent of carrier pattern using the opponent motion cue. Consistent with mouse behavior, neural responses to the same stimuli recorded in mouse visual areas V1, RL, and LM also did not support texture-invariant segmentation of figures using opponent motion. Modeling revealed that the texture dependence of both the mouse's behavior and neural responses could be explained by a feedforward neural network lacking explicit segmentation capabilities. These findings reveal a fundamental limitation in the ability of mice to segment visual objects compared to primates.},

  abstract = {The laminar location of the cell bodies and terminals of interareal connections determines the hierarchical structural organization of the cortex and has been intensively studied. However, we still have only a rudimentary understanding of the connectional principles of feedforward (FF) and feedback (FB) pathways. Quantitative analysis of retrograde tracers was used to extend the notion that the laminar distribution of neurons interconnecting visual areas provides an index of hierarchical distance (percentage of supragranular labeled neurons [SLN]). We show that: 1) SLN values constrain models of cortical hierarchy, revealing previously unsuspected areal relations; 2) SLN reflects the operation of a combinatorial distance rule acting differentially on sets of connections between areas; 3) Supragranular layers contain highly segregated bottom-up and top-down streams, both of which exhibit point-to-point connectivity. This contrasts with the infragranular layers, which contain diffuse bottom-up and top-down streams; 4) Cell filling of the parent neurons of FF and FB pathways provides further evidence of compartmentalization; 5) FF pathways have higher weights, cross fewer hierarchical levels, and are less numerous than FB pathways. Taken together, the present results suggest that cortical hierarchies are built from supra- and infragranular counterstreams. This compartmentalized dual counterstream organization allows point-to-point connectivity in both bottom-up and top-down directions. J. Comp.

New imaging techniques are allowing the circuit mechanisms underlying orientation and direction selectivity to be studied with clarity that was not possible a decade ago. However, these new techniques bring new challenges: robust quantitative measurements are needed to evaluate the findings from these studies, which can involve thousands of cells of varying response strength. Here we show that traditional measures of selectivity such as the orientation index (OI) and direction index (DI) are poorly suited for quantitative evaluation of orientation and direction tuning. We explore several alternative methods for quantifying tuning and for addressing a variety of questions that arise in studies on orientation- and direction-tuned cells and cell populations. We provide recommendations for which methods are best suited to which applications and we offer tips for avoiding potential pitfalls in applying these methods. Our goal is to supply a solid quantitative foundation for studies involving orientation and direction tuning.},

  abstract = {Illusory contours (perceived edges that exist in the absence of local stimulus borders) demonstrate that perception is an active process, creating features not present in the light patterns striking the retina. Illusory contours are thought to be processed using mechanisms that partially overlap with those of ``real'' contours, but questions about the neural substrate of these percepts remain. Here, we employed functional magnetic resonance imaging to obtain physiological signals from human visual cortex while subjects viewed different types of contours, both real and illusory. We sampled these signals independently from nine visual areas, each defined by retinotopic or other independent criteria. Using both within- and across-subject analysis, we found evidence for overlapping sites of processing; most areas responded to most types of contours. However, there were distinctive differences in the strength of activity across areas and contour types. Two types of illusory contours differed in the strength of activation of the retinotopic areas, but both types activated crudely retinotopic visual areas, including V3A, V4v, V7, and V8, bilaterally. The extent of activation was largely invariant across a range of stimulus sizes that produce illusory contours perceptually, but it was related to the spatial frequency of displaced-grating stimuli. Finally, there was a striking similarity in the pattern of results for the illusory contour-defined shape and a similar shape defined by stereoscopic depth. These and other results suggest a role in surface perception for this lateral occipital region that includes V3A, V4v, V7, and V8.},

Bottom-up and top-down influences are exerted through distinct frequency channels, as was recently revealed in macaques by correlating inter-areal influences with laminar anatomical projection patterns. Because this anatomical data cannot be obtained in human subjects, we selected seven homologous macaque and human visual areas, and we correlated the macaque laminar projection patterns to human inter-areal directed influences as measured with magnetoencephalography. We show that influences along feedforward projections predominate in the gamma band, whereas influences along feedback projections predominate in the alpha-beta band. Rhythmic inter-areal influences constrain a functional hierarchy of the seven homologous human visual areas that is in close agreement with the respective macaque anatomical hierarchy. Rhythmic influences allow an extension of the hierarchy to 26 human visual areas including uniquely human brain areas. Hierarchical levels of ventral- and dorsal-stream visual areas are differentially affected by inter-areal influences in the alpha-beta band.},

However, experimental evidence for error units, which are central to the theory, is inconclusive, and it remains unclear how hPC can be implemented with spiking neurons. To address this, we connect hPC to existing work on efficient coding in balanced networks with lateral inhibition, and predictive computation at apical dendrites. Together, this work points to an efficient implementation of hPC with spiking neurons, where prediction errors are computed not in separate units, but locally in dendritic compartments. The implied model shows a remarkable correspondence to experimentally observed cortical connectivity patterns, plasticity and dynamics, and at the same time can explain hallmarks of predictive processing, such as mismatch responses, in cortex. We thus propose dendritic predictive coding as one of the main organizational principles of cortex.},

  abstract = {The backpropagation of error algorithm (backprop) has been instrumental in the recent success of deep learning. However, a key question remains as to whether backprop can be formulated in a manner suitable for implementation in neural circuitry. The primary challenge is to ensure that any candidate formulation uses only local information, rather than relying on global signals as in standard backprop. Recently several algorithms for approximating backprop using only local signals have been proposed. However, these algorithms typically impose other requirements which challenge biological plausibility: for example, requiring complex and precise connectivity schemes, or multiple sequential backwards phases with information being stored across phases. Here, we propose a novel algorithm, Activation Relaxation (AR), which is motivated by constructing the backpropagation gradient as the equilibrium point of a dynamical system. Our algorithm converges rapidly and robustly to the correct backpropagation gradients, requires only a single type of computational unit, utilises only a single parallel backwards relaxation phase, and can operate on arbitrary computation graphs. We illustrate these properties by training deep neural networks on visual classification tasks, and describe simplifications to the algorithm which remove further obstacles to neurobiological implementation (for example, the weight-transport problem, and the use of nonlinear derivatives), while preserving performance.},

  abstract = {Backpropagation of error (backprop) is a powerful algorithm for training machine learning architectures through end-to-end differentiation. However, backprop is often criticised for lacking biological plausibility. Recently, it has been shown that backprop in multilayer-perceptrons (MLPs) can be approximated using predictive coding, a biologically-plausible process theory of cortical computation which relies only on local and Hebbian updates. The power of backprop, however, lies not in its instantiation in MLPs, but rather in the concept of automatic differentiation which allows for the optimisation of any differentiable program expressed as a computation graph. Here, we demonstrate that predictive coding converges asymptotically (and in practice rapidly) to exact backprop gradients on arbitrary computation graphs using only local learning rules. We apply this result to develop a straightforward strategy to translate core machine learning architectures into their predictive coding equivalents. We construct predictive coding CNNs, RNNs, and the more complex LSTMs, which include a non-layer-like branching internal graph structure and multiplicative interactions. Our models perform equivalently to backprop on challenging machine learning benchmarks, while utilising only local and (mostly) Hebbian plasticity. Our method raises the potential that standard machine learning algorithms could in principle be directly implemented in neural circuitry, and may also contribute to the development of completely distributed neuromorphic architectures.},

  abstract = {A large body of work on neural encoding has focused on ``cascade'' type models such as the linear-nonlinear-Poisson (LNP) model. This approach seeks to describe the encoding process in terms of a series of stages: (1) projection of the stimulus onto a bank of linear filters; (2) a nonlinear function combining these filter outputs; and (3) a noisy spike generation process. Here we explore the relationship of the LNP modeling framework to more recent approaches arising from the deep learning literature. Specifically, we show that deep neural network (DNN) and convolutional neural network (CNN) models of neural activity sit firmly within the LNP framework, and correspond to particular parametrizations of the nonlinear stage of the LNP model. Using data from primate retina and primary visual cortex, we compare the performance of LNP models fit with deep learning methods to LNP models fit with traditional estimators, including spike-triggered covariance (STC), information-theoretic spike-triggered averaging and covariance (iSTAC), and maximum likelihood estimators also known as ``maximally informative dimensions'' (MID). We show that models with nonlinearities parametrized by deep networks achieve higher accuracy for a fixed number of filters, and can extract a larger number of informative filters than traditional models. Finally, we perform a dimensionality analysis of LNP models trained with deep learning methods, revealing that a large number of filters are needed to accurately describe the neural responses of many cells even early in the visual pathway. This result overturns one of the central tenets of the LNP modeling framework: that neural computations are low-dimensional, or depend on the stimulus only via its projection onto a small number of linear filters. We discuss the implications of these findings for both the fitting and interpretation of LNP encoding models.},

Each cortical area is responsible for maintaining and updating the organism's knowledge of a specific aspect of the world, ranging from low level raw data to high level abstract representations, and involving interpreting stimuli and generating actions. In doing this, it will draw on multiple sources of expertise, learned from experience, creating multiple, often conflicting, hypotheses which are integrated by the action of the thalamic neurons and then sent back to the standard input layer of the cortex. Thus this nucleus plays the role of an active blackboard on which the current best reconstruction of some aspect of the world is always displayed. Evidence for this theory is reviewed and experimental tests are proposed. A sequel to this paper will discuss the cortico-cortical loops and propose quite different computational roles for them.},

J Neurosci 24:1428-1438]. To further test this hypothesis, we compared the strength of orientation and spatial phase selectivity of surround suppression, and the spatial extent of the extraclassical receptive field (ECRF) between the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and V1 neurons of anesthetized cats. Extraclassical surround suppression in the LGN was well tuned to orientation-contrast and relative spatial phase between the classical receptive field (CRF) and ECRF stimuli. Significant orientation-tuned surround suppression was observed in 72.6\% of the LGN neurons and the 66.7\% of the V1 neurons tested. The degree of orientation selectivity of ECRF in LGN was comparable to that in V1; however, the strength of the relative spatial phase selectivity of ECRF in LGN was higher than that previously reported for V1 [Akasaki T, Sato H, Yoshimura Y, Ozeki H, Shimegi S (2002) Suppressive effects of receptive field surround on neuronal activity in the cat primary visual cortex. Neurosci Res 43:207-220; DeAngelis GC, Freeman RD, Ohzawa I (1994) Length and width tuning of neurons in the cat's primary visual cortex. J Neurophysiol 71:347-374]. In 70\% of the LGN neurons that exhibited significant orientation-tuned extraclassical surround suppression, the effective orientation of the suppression varied according to a change in the orientation of CRF stimulus, while the remaining 30\% exhibited a fixed preferred orientation of the suppression regardless of the orientation of the CRF grating. These results suggest that the basic properties of surround suppression, such as orientation and spatial phase tuning, already exist in cat LGN and that a decrease of surround suppression in excitatory inputs from LGN by surround suppression is the primary cause of surround suppression in V1. Corticogeniculate feedback may further elaborate the properties of surround suppression in LGN.},

Recently, some studies have shown that higher order visual areas influence the activity of the primary visual cortex, refining its processing capabilities. Here, we studied how in vivo optogenetic inactivation of two higher order visual areas with different functional properties affects responses evoked by moving bars in the primary visual cortex. In contrast with the prevailing view, our results demonstrate that distinct higher order visual areas similarly modulate early visual processing. In particular, these areas enhance stimulus responsiveness in the primary visual cortex, by more strongly amplifying weaker compared with stronger sensory-evoked responses (for instance specifically amplifying responses to stimuli not moving along the direction preferred by individual neurons) and by facilitating responses to stimuli entering the receptive field of single neurons. Such enhancement, however, comes at the expense of orientation and direction selectivity, which increased when the selected higher order visual areas were inactivated. Thus, feedback from higher order visual areas selectively amplifies weak sensory-evoked V1 responses, which may enable more robust processing of visual stimuli.},

However, small receptive fields tend to confound the orientation and velocity of moving edges, leading to ambiguous or inaccurate motion measurements (the aperture problem). Thus, it is often assumed that neurons in primary visual cortex (V1) carry only ambiguous motion information. Here we show that a subpopulation of V1 neurons is capable of signaling motion direction in a manner that is independent of contour orientation. Specifically, end-stopped V1 neurons obtain accurate motion measurements by responding only to the endpoints of long contours, a strategy which renders them largely immune to the aperture problem. Furthermore, the time course of end-stopping is similar to the time course of motion integration by MT neurons. These results suggest that cortical neurons might represent object motion by responding selectively to two-dimensional discontinuities in the visual scene.},

Our results suggest that higher-order visual areas may fill in the missing information in the early visual cortex necessary for illusory contour perception.                                         SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT               Perception of the Kanizsa illusory contours is impaired in neurodevelopmental disorders such as schizophrenia, autism, and Williams syndrome. However, the mechanism of the illusory contour perception is poorly understood. Here we describe the behavioral and neural correlates of Kanizsa illusory contours perception in mice, a genetically tractable model system. We show that top-down feedback controls the neural responses to Kanizsa illusion in V1. To our knowledge, this is the first description of the neural correlates of the Kanizsa illusion in mice and the first causal demonstration of their regulation by top-down feedback.},

  abstract = {The cortical processing of illusory contours provides a unique window for exploring the brain mechanisms underlying visual perception. Previous electrophysiological single-cell recordings demonstrate that a subgroup of cells in macaque V1 and V2 signal the presence of illusory contours, whereas recent human brain imaging studies reveal higher-order visual cortices playing a central role in illusory figure processing. It seems that the processing of illusory contours/figures may engage multiple cortical interactions between hierarchically organized processing stages in the ventral visual pathway of primates. However, it is not yet known in which brain areas illusory contours are represented in the same manner as real contours at both the population and single-cell levels. Here, by combining intrinsic optical imaging in anesthetized rhesus macaques with single-cell recordings in awake ones, we found a complete overlap of orientation domains in visual cortical area V4 for processing real and illusory contours. In contrast, the orientation domains mapped in early visual areas V1 and V2 mainly encoded the local physical stimulus features inducing the subjective perception of global illusory contours. Our results indicate that real and illusory contours are encoded equivalently by the same functional domains in V4, suggesting that V4 is a key cortical locus for integration of local features into global contours.},

  abstract = {Pyramidal neurons integrate synaptic inputs from basal and apical dendrites to generate stimulus-specific responses. It has been proposed that feed-forward inputs to basal dendrites drive a neuron's stimulus preference, while feedback inputs to apical dendrites sharpen selectivity. However, how a neuron's dendritic domains relate to its functional selectivity has not been demonstrated experimentally. We performed 2-photon dendritic micro-dissection on layer-2/3 pyramidal neurons in mouse primary visual cortex. We found that removing the apical dendritic tuft did not alter orientation-tuning. Furthermore, orientation-tuning curves were remarkably robust to the removal of basal dendrites: ablation of 2 basal dendrites was needed to cause a small shift in orientation preference, without significantly altering tuning width. Computational modeling corroborated our results and put limits on how orientation preferences among basal dendrites differ in order to reproduce the post-ablation data. In conclusion, neuronal orientation-tuning appears remarkably robust to loss of dendritic input.},

  abstract = {The active visual system comprises the visual cortices, cerebral attention networks, and oculomotor system. While fascinating in its own right, it is also an important model for sensorimotor networks in general. A prominent approach to studying this system is active inference---which assumes the brain makes use of an internal (generative) model to predict proprioceptive and visual input. This approach treats action as ensuring sensations conform to predictions (i.e., by moving the eyes) and posits that visual percepts are the consequence of updating predictions to conform to sensations. Under active inference, the challenge is to identify the form of the generative model that makes these predictions---and thus directs behavior. In this paper, we provide an overview of the generative models that the brain must employ to engage in active vision. This means specifying the processes that explain retinal cell activity and proprioceptive information from oculomotor muscle fibers. In addition to the mechanics of the eyes and retina, these processes include our choices about where to move our eyes. These decisions rest upon beliefs about salient locations, or the potential for information gain and belief-updating. A key theme of this paper is the relationship between ``looking'' and ``seeing'' under the brain's implicit generative model of the visual world.},

To understand the spatial extent of excitatory and inhibitory influences on V1 neurons, we performed area-summation experiments with suprathreshold contrast stimulation. The extent of spatial summation and the magnitude of surround suppression were estimated quantitatively by analyzing the spatial summation experiments with a difference of Gaussians (DOG) model. The average extent of spatial summation is approximately the same across layers except for layer 6 cells, which tend to sum more extensively than cells in the other layers. On average, the extent of length and width summation is approximately equal. Across the population, surround suppression is greatest in layer 4B and weakest in layer 6. Estimates of summation and suppression are compared for the DOG (subtractive) model and a normalization (divisive) model. The two models yield quantitatively similar estimates of the extent of excitation and inhibition. However, the normalization (divisive) model predicts weaker surround strength than the DOG model.},

  abstract = {Vision is the sense humans rely on most to navigate the world, make decisions, and perform complex tasks. Understanding how humans see thus represents one of the most fundamental and important goals of neuroscience. The use of the mouse as a model for parsing how vision works at a fundamental level started approximately a decade ago, ushered in by the mouse's convenient size, relatively low cost, and, above all, amenability to genetic perturbations. In the course of that effort, a large cadre of new and powerful tools for in vivo labeling, monitoring, and manipulation of neurons were applied to this species. As a consequence, a significant body of work now exists on the architecture, function, and development of mouse central visual pathways. Excitingly, much of that work includes causal testing of the role of specific cell types and circuits in visual perception and behavior---something rare to find in studies of the visual system of other species. Indeed, one could argue that more information is now available about the mouse visual system than any other sensory system, in any species, including humans. As such, the mouse visual system has become a platform for multilevel analysis of the mammalian central nervous system generally. Here we review the mouse visual system structure, function, and development literature and comment on the similarities and differences between the visual system of this and other model species. We also make it a point to highlight the aspects of mouse visual circuitry that remain opaque and that are in need of additional experimentation to enrich our understanding of how vision works on a broad scale.},

  abstract = {When sensory information is incomplete or ambiguous, the brain relies on prior expectations to infer perceptual objects. Despite the centrality of this process to perception, the neural mechanism of sensory inference is not known. Illusory contours (ICs) are key tools to study sensory inference because they contain edges or objects that are implied only by their spatial context. Using cellular resolution, mesoscale two-photon calcium imaging and multi-Neuropixels recordings in the mouse visual cortex, we identified a sparse subset of neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1) and higher visual areas that respond emergently to ICs. We found that these highly selective 'ICencoders' mediate the neural representation of IC inference. Strikingly, selective activation of these neurons using two-photon holographic optogenetics was sufficient to recreate IC representation in the rest of the V1 network, in the absence of any visual stimulus. This outlines a model in which primary sensory cortex facilitates sensory inference by selectively strengthening input patterns that match prior expectations through local, recurrent circuitry. Our data thus suggest a clear computational purpose for recurrence in the generation of holistic percepts under sensory ambiguity. More generally, selective reinforcement of top-down predictions by patterncompleting recurrent circuits in lower sensory cortices may constitute a key step in sensory inference.},

The RF center-surround organization of mouse V1 neurons was qualitatively similar to that for macaque monkeys (i.e., the RF center is surrounded by extended suppressive regions). However, unlike in monkey V2, a significant proportion of cortical neurons, largely complex cells in V2L, did not exhibit quantifiable RF surround suppression. Simple cells had smaller RF centers than complex cells, and the prevalence and strength of surround suppression were greater in simple cells than in complex cells. These findings, particularly on the RF center-surround organization of visual cortical neurons, give new insights into the principles governing cortical circuits in the mouse visual cortex and should provide further impetus for the use of mice in studies on the genetic and molecular basis of RF development and synaptic plasticity.

  abstract = {We propose a neural model of visual object-based attention in which the identity of an object is used to select its location in an array of objects. The model is based on neural activity observed in visual search tasks performed by monkeys. In the model, the identity of the object (target) is selected in the higher areas of the ventral stream by means of a cue. Feedback activation from these higher areas carries information about the identity of the target to the (lower) retinotopic areas of the ventral stream. In these areas, the feedback activation interacts with feedforward activation produced by the object array. The interaction occurs in local microcircuits, and results in a selective activation on locations in the retinotopic areas of the visual stream that correspond to the location of the target in the object array. The selective activation consists of a form of gain control, produced by disinhibition. Transmitted to the dorsal stream, this activation directs spatial attention to the location of the target. In this way, an action directed at the target can be generated.},

  abstract = {We have studied the mechanism of contour perception by recording from neurons in the visual cortex of alert rhesus monkeys. In order to assess the relationship between neural signals and perception, we compared the responses to edges and lines with the responses to patterns in which human observers perceive a contour where no line or edge is given (anomalous contour), such as the border between gratings of thin lines offset by half a cycle. With only one exception out of 60, orientation-selective neurons in area V1 did not signal the anomalous contour. Many neurons failed to respond to this stimulus at all, others responded according to the orientation of the grating lines. In area V2, 45 of 103 neurons (44\%) signaled the orientation of the anomalous contour. Sixteen did so without signaling the orientation of the inducing lines. Some responded better to anomalous contours than to the optimum bars or edges. Preferred orientations and widths of tuning for anomalous contour and bar or edge were found to be highly correlated, but not identical, in each neuron. Similar to perception, the neuronal responses depended on a minimum number of lines inducing the contour, but not so much on line spacing, and tended to be weaker when the lines were oblique rather than orthogonal to the border. With oblique lines, the orientations signaled were biased towards the orientation orthogonal to the lines, as in the Zollner illusion. We conclude that contours may be defined first at the level of V2. While the unresponsiveness of neurons in V1 to this type of anomalous contour is in agreement with linear filter predictions, the responses of V2 neurons need to be explained. We assume that they sum the signals of 2 parallel paths, one that defines edges and lines and another that defines anomalous contours by pooling signals from end-stopped receptive fields oriented mainly orthogonal to the contour.},

  abstract = {Understanding the brain's perception algorithm is a highly intricate problem, as the inherent complexity of sensory inputs and the brain's nonlinear processing make characterizing sensory representations difficult. Recent studies have shown that functional models---capable of predicting large-scale neuronal activity in response to arbitrary sensory input---can be powerful tools for characterizing neuronal representations by enabling high-throughput             in silico             experiments. However, accurately modeling responses to dynamic and ecologically relevant inputs like videos remains challenging, particularly when generalizing to new stimulus domains outside the training distribution. Inspired by recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, where foundation models---trained on vast quantities of data--- have demonstrated remarkable capabilities and generalization, we developed a ``foundation model'' of the mouse visual cortex: a deep neural network trained on large amounts of neuronal responses to ecological videos from multiple visual cortical areas and mice. The model accurately predicted neuronal responses not only to natural videos but also to various new stimulus domains, such as coherent moving dots and noise patterns, underscoring its generalization abilities. The foundation model could also be adapted to new mice with minimal natural movie training data. We applied the foundation model to the MICrONS dataset: a study of the brain that integrates structure with function at unprecedented scale, containing nanometer-scale morphology, connectivity with {$>$}500,000,000 synapses, and function of {$>$}70,000 neurons within a {$\sim$} 1mm             3             volume spanning multiple areas of the mouse visual cortex. This accurate functional model of the MICrONS data opens the possibility for a systematic characterization of the relationship between circuit structure and function. By precisely capturing the response properties of the visual cortex and generalizing to new stimulus domains and mice, foundation models can pave the way for a deeper understanding of visual computation.},

  abstract = {A common challenge for Bayesian models of perception is the fact that the two fundamental Bayesian components, the prior distribution and the likelihood func- tion, are formally unconstrained. Here we argue that a neural system that emulates Bayesian inference is naturally constrained by the way it represents sensory infor- mation in populations of neurons. More specifically, we show that an efficient coding principle creates a direct link between prior and likelihood based on the underlying stimulus distribution. The resulting Bayesian estimates can show bi- ases away from the peaks of the prior distribution, a behavior seemingly at odds with the traditional view of Bayesian estimation, yet one that has been reported in human perception. We demonstrate that our framework correctly accounts for the repulsive biases previously reported for the perception of visual orientation, and show that the predicted tuning characteristics of the model neurons match the reported orientation tuning properties of neurons in primary visual cortex. Our results suggest that efficient coding is a promising hypothesis in constrain- ing Bayesian models of perceptual inference.},

A subsequent feedback process originating in frontoparietal areas through reciprocal connections to striate cortex provides attentional support to salient or behaviorally-relevant features. Here, we review mounting evidence that feedback signals also originate within extrastriate regions and begin during the initial feedforward process. This feedback process is temporally dissociable from attention and provides important functions such as grouping, associational reinforcement, and filling-in of features. Local feedback signals operating concurrently with feedforward processing are important for object identification in noisy real-world situations, particularly when objects are partially occluded, unclear, or otherwise ambiguous. Altogether, the dissociation of early and late feedback processes presented here expands on current models of object identification, and suggests a dual role for descending feedback projections.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Here we report a property of end stopping in V1 that distinguishes among different sign-of-contrast situations, thereby obviating the need for explicit junction detectors. We show that the inhibitory effect of the end zones in end-stopped cells is highly selective for the relative sign of contrast between the central activating stimulus and stimuli presented at the end zones. Conversely, the facilitatory effect of end zones in length-summing cells is not selective for the relative sign of contrast between the central activating stimulus and stimuli presented at the end zones. This finding indicates that end stopping belongs in the category of cortical computations that are selective for sign of contrast, such as direction selectivity and disparity selectivity, but length summation does not.},

The amount of visual information is significantly degraded when it reaches the V1 after entering the retina; nevertheless, this does not affect our visual perception of the outside world. Currently, the mechanisms of visual information degradation from retina to V1 are still unclear. For this purpose, the current study used the experimental data summarized by Marcus E. Raichle to investigate the neural mechanisms underlying the degradation of the large amount of data from topological mapping from retina to V1, drawing on the photoreceptor model first. The obtained results showed that the image edge features of visual information were extracted by the convolution algorithm with respect to the function of synaptic plasticity when visual signals were hierarchically processed from low-level to high-level. The visual processing was characterized by the visual information degradation, and this compensatory mechanism embodied the principles of energy minimization and transmission efficiency maximization of brain activity, which matched the experimental data summarized by Marcus E. Raichle. Our results further the understanding of the information processing mechanism of the visual nervous system.},
